# AdSandbox

### Take a shovel and pail to ads everywhere by putting them in sandboxes and securing your web surfing experience without blocking them (and journalism profits) entirely.

## What is this and why should I use this?

AdSandboxer takes a different approach from ad blockers. Specifically it isn't about blocking ads. Instead it aims to secure you from malicious ad code while leaving ad units in place. The goal is to secure your browsing experience while leaving in place the capacity for journalists to make money.
